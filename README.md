Driving Growth and Profitability: A Data-Driven Approach to Sales and Customer Insights
Trendify, a growing e-commerce company, faced challenges in understanding the drivers of sales performance and customer behavior. While sales were increasing, profitability was inconsistent, and the team lacked visibility into customer loyalty and high-value segments. The goal was to build two Power BI dashboards to analyze sales performance and customer behavior.

Key Points
• Inconsistent Profit Margins: Profitability varied across product categories despite growing sales.
• Seasonal Trends: Lack of visibility into peak/off-peak sales and order periods.
• Customer Retention: Difficulty identifying high-value customers and repeat orders.

KPIs
• Sales Growth: 15.01% (2022: $309.3M → 2023: $355.7M).
• Profit Growth: 30.3% (2022: $492.3M → 2023: $641.4M).
• Orders Growth: 25.81% (2022: 2.6K → 2023: 3.3K).

Goals
1. Increase overall profit margins by 10% by end of 2024.
2. Boost February 2024 sales by 20% compared to 2023.
3. Reduce losses for Machines by 50% by end of 2024.
