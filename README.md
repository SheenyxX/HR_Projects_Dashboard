# Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](/d6.png)

## Project Overview
This Power BI analytics solution was developed for Trendify, a growing e-commerce company, to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights. The project addresses key challenges in profitability tracking, customer behavior analysis, and sales performance optimization.

## Business Challenges
- **Inconsistent Profit Margins**: Varying profitability across product categories despite sales growth
- **Seasonal Trends**: Lack of visibility into peak/off-peak periods
- **Customer Retention**: Difficulty identifying high-value customer segments

## Key Metrics & Achievements
| KPI | 2022 | 2023 | Growth |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Sales | $309.3M | $355.7M | +15.01% |
| Profit | $492.3M | $641.4M | +30.3% |
| Orders | 2.6K | 3.3K | +25.81% |

## Dashboard Features
### 1. Sales & Profit Dashboard
- Profit margin analysis by product category
- Year-over-Year performance comparisons
- Identification of underperforming products (e.g., Machines category with -130.8% profit decline)

### 2. Orders & Customers Dashboard
- Customer segmentation by profitability
- Geographic performance analysis
- Order volume trends (December peak: 462 orders vs February low: 107 orders)

## Technical Implementation
### Data Model
- **4 Core Tables**: Products (1,892 rows), Orders (9,994 rows), Customers (793 rows), Location (632 rows)
- **Relationships**: Connected via Product_ID, Customer_ID, and Postal_Code keys

### Key DAX Measures
```dax
Profit Growth % = 
VAR CurrentProfit = [Current Year Profit]
VAR PreviousProfit = [Previous Year Profit]
RETURN
IF(
    ISBLANK(PreviousProfit) || PreviousProfit = 0,
    BLANK(),
    (CurrentProfit - PreviousProfit) / PreviousProfit
)


## Business Recommendations
1. **Pricing Optimization**: Address Machines category's negative profitability through cost analysis
2. **Seasonal Promotions**: Target February sales boost (goal: +20% vs 2023)
3. **Loyalty Program**: Focus on high-value customers (top 10 contribute 30% of profit)
